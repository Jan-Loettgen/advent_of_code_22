# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022, implemented in Rust. I am working through the problems after the actual time of the challenge as I did not have to to compete in December. This is a side project I am working on to learn to improve my rust programming skills after having have read the book. All of the implemented solutions are my own attempt without having have looked at the solutions before so the solutions will liekly be suboptimal. Lastly as I am still learning rust the implementations will likely also be suboptimal.

### Approach: 
1. Hard coded
2. Brute force
3. Brute force
4. Brute force
5. Brute force
6. Brute force
7. Recursive Brute force
8. Brute force
9. Brute force
10. Brute force
11. Modular arithmetic
12. Part 1: A*. Part 2: Dijkstra. Both animated in terminal
