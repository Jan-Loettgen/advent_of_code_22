# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022, implemented in Rust. I am working through the problems after the actual time of the challenge as I did not have to to compete in December. This is a side project I am working on to learn to improve my rust programming skills after having have read the book. All of the implemented solutions are my own attempt without having have looked at the solutions before so the solutions will liekly be suboptimal. Lastly as I am still learning rust the implementations will likely also be suboptimal.

### Approach: 
1. Hard coded
2. Brute force
3. Brute force
4. Brute force
5. Brute force
6. Brute force
7. Recursive brute force
8. Brute force
9. Brute force
10. Brute force
11. Modular arithmetic
12. Part 1: A*. Part 2: Dijkstra. Both animated in terminal

### To use:
Like will only run on an ubuntu based system, as characters in the text files will be different on different operating systems. E.g. windows adds a carriage return before end of line in a text file.

Go to src/main.rs and comment or uncomment the solve functions corresponding to each day. The solve functions takes as input an integer 1 for problem 1, 2 for problem 2. The day 12 problems are animated in the terminal, providing an argument of false to the day 12 solve() call will disable the animations. Build and run the code via "cargo run", and the solutions will be printed to the terminal.
